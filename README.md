# OpenColleges-TaxCalculator
This is the Open Colleges - Module 8 Part B Assessment - Tax Calculator

This is my version of the required assessment for module 8, a winform that creates an Employee or Contractor object with the entered data and calculates their tax payable based on pre determined tax rates from a txt file called rates.txt which can then be saved to a PDF.

This repository can be used as a learning tool. Please do not submit as your own work.

***Sorry if I have uploaded too much/not enough, i'm still working out this github business. Cheers***
